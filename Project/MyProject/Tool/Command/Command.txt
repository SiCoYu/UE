======================
Console Variable

Description

r.SetRes
To change the screen/window resolution.

r.VSync
To enabled/disable VSync (might depend on native fullscreen).

r.ScreenPercentage
To reduce the internal render resolution, the image gets upsamples in another pass, see above.

r.AllowOcclusionQueries
To disable occlusion (can make scenes slower).

r.TiledDeferredShading
Allows to turn off the tile based deferred lighting technique (GPU particle lights do not have a fallback).

r.TiledDeferredShading.MinimumCount
Adjust how many lights we need to activate the tile based deferred lighting technique (no visual difference but can be a performance difference).

Pause
Stop the game or matinee (much more reliable profiling but disables updates/ticks).

Slomo
Allows to slow down or accelerate time.

r.VisualizeOccludedPrimitives
Displays the bounding boxes of occluded primitives.

StartFPSChart StopFPSChart

See below.

r.SeparateTranslucency
The feature fixes translucency with depth of field, can be disabled if not needed, has other implications (reading SceneColor).

r.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization
To disable the noise we add in the tonemapper to avoid color banding because of 8bit quantization, minor quality improvement, not needed when we output in 10:10:10.

r.SceneColorFormat
Allows to use a different scenecolor format (default is 64bit for best quality and to support screenspace subsurface scattering).
FX.AllowGPUSorting

To disable particle sorting (pays off when used for a lot of particles).
FX.FreezeParticleSimulation

To disable the particle updates.
r.SSR.MaxRoughness

Adjust the max roughness of Screen Space Reflections, to override the postprocess settings, see Show Flag VisualizeSSR.
Command Line Options

Certain features can be disabled on the command line e.g. **UE4.exe -NoSound**The most useful ones for profiling:

Commandline Option

Description

-NoSound
To disable the sound and music system.

-NoTextureStreaming
To disable texture streaming (good to isolate where hitches are coming from).

-NoVerifyGC
Otherwise expect massive hitching in Release builds at least every 30 seconds or so.

-NoVSync
Gives faster rendering but can result in image tearing, especially important with high FPS.

-Streaming
Useful with StartFPSChart/StopFPSChart to get the data from a non windows device to the cooking PC for further investigations (assuming we use cook on the fly).
