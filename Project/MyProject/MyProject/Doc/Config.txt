UE4 安卓下找不到蓝图资源 
http://blog.csdn.net/lzt20007/article/details/50945629

解决方案：
一：修改配置
修改DefaultEditor.ini中bDontLoadBlueprintOutsideEditor的值，true->false
二：修改代码
static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<UBlueprint> tankGameBPAsset(TEXT("Blueprint'/Game/Blueprints/tankGameBP.tankGameBP'"));
if (tankGameBPAsset.Object != NULL)
{
	DefaultPawnClass = (UClass*)tankGameBPAsset.Object->GeneratedClass;
}
改为：
static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<UClass> tankGameBPAsset(TEXT("Class'/Game/Blueprints/tankGameBP.tankGameBP_C'"));
if (tankGameBPAsset.Object != NULL)
{
DefaultPawnClass = (UClass*)tankGameBPAsset.Object;
}

=============
UE 4.19.1 启动报错
无法启动此程序，因为计算机中丢失
UE4Editor-ApexDestruction-Win64-Debug.dll
尝试重新安装该程序以解决此问题

原因
https://github.com/UE4-OceanProject/OceanProject/issues/49
Epic changed how ApexDestruction works in the engine (it's now a separate plugin).

I've added it as a plugin dependency on 6e54a16. It works here, but I"m not sure yet if it will work on every system. Can you, please, test and report back?

Thank you very much!

I can confirm that upgrading from VS Community 2017 15.2 to 15.4.1 allowed for successful rebuilding of the two problem dlls, and everything is working fine now. Thanks!

Hello,

I had the same issue @ibrews ,
I got a popup saying that I was missing the two dll's or that they are compiled with a different engine version.
Here's how I solved it:

Install the Windows v8.1 SDK (this is just the sdk not windows itself)
Link: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk
Run cmd with this command:
"(Your drive letter):/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_4.18/Engine/Binaries/DotNET/UnrealBuildTool.exe" OceanProject Development Win64 -project="(drive letter):/(User Profile)/Documents/Unreal Projects/(Project)/OceanProject.uproject" -editorrecompile -progress"
Wait for cmd to finish.
Startup the project (I have copied all the files from the github folder OceanProject-Master to my own created project then running the unreal project .exe that you have copied from the github project folder) I have run it with engine version 4.18. In my case it needs to compile some shaders, but after that no problems acure as far as I have tested it when there are problems I will post a new command with the fix for it.

Hope this helps for people that are still looking for a solution.

解决方法
在工程文件
G:\UE\Project\MyProject\MyProject\MyProject.uproject
最后添加
"Plugins":
[
	{
		"Name": "ApexDestruction",
		"Enabled": true
	}
]

然后升级 VS 到最新版本，可能 UE4 的系统库编译使用的是 VS 的最新版本
